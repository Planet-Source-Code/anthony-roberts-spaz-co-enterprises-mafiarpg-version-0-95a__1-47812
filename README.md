## \[Spaz Co\. Enterprises\] \- MafiaRPG \(Version 0\.95a\)


</div>

### Description

A complex game based around a mafia which enjoys corporate domination. You play the son of a debted father, attempting to raise from a petty thug to an overexposed Godfather. Using various weapons, cars, strateic movements, and other stuff in the game - take the lead over your competitors by hiring lackies to do your work, heisting poor old ladies and robbing federal banks, playing the slots at the local casino, destroying the petty wannabe thugs on the streets, participate in gambled blood rings, and many other various features.

The map is incomplete and not quite working yet, and the game does have some bugs. I'd love to see what anyone can do to this game :)

[UPDATE!]: The file was updated as of January 30, 2004 with new copyrights, and very few bug fixes. It's still very BAD with bugs, but, I've stopped working on this version - MafiaRPG 2 is my current Visual Basic development.
 
### More Info
 
This game is intended for mature audiences (18 and older) due to adult situations (Partaining from Prostitution, Sexual encounters, etc.)

There's a possibility that when opening the program, the Button.ctl file is not found. To place it in, go Project - Add User Control... - Existing - Double click the Button.ctl file - on frmRPG delete cmdAtt and cmdFlee and place the new button on the form in their positions, named cmdAtt and cmdFlee. These buttons are practically required in this form, so that it's impossible to hold enter to fight constantly, like you could do with a normal command button.
